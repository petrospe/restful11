# Restful taskmanager app

The main purpose is to administer tasks via calendar. The api and frontend render are based on Slim Framework. Also used Bootstrap and Jquery libraries.

### Tech

The app uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Slim Framework](http://www.slimframework.com/) - Minified php framework
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [jQuery] - duh
